support for async, nonblocking (nio) request and response handling/streaming
   - Todo:
      - [DONE] mockup the streaming api
      - [DONE] port existing stuff to it
      - make it actually work async & deal with closing issues 
make requests immutable "values"
   - re-readable?
remove impurities in the request model
   - get rid of path().valueFor()?
