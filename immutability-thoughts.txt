How should we handle immutability?
  - don't loose the data
  - copy reasonably small stuff in memory
  - switch to disk if it starts to get large
  - allow for tuning
     - per path?
     - per object?
  - there will need to be some sanity checks
     - rolling window for really large/infinite streams?
     - throw Exception when things have taken too long?

Ideal:
  - things should be fail fast, caught at test-time instead of at runtime
    - IDEA: force the cacheing strategy to be defined at read time, falling back to no-caching?
